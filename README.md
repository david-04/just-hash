# just-hash

A simple web application to digest multiple input values into a single/combined SHA-512 hash. No seeds are used. The same input always yields the same output. It can be used to derive strong keys/passwords. The application can be downloaded as a single HTML file from [here](https://github.com/david-04/just-hash/blob/main/docs/index.html) or accessed online at:

The input is re-hashed multiple times. It can take a while until the result is displayed. This is by design to make brute force attacks harder.
